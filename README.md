# PressKeyByVoice


PressKeyByVoice is a simplistic application that allows you to assign a keyboard key(character) to be pressed when the audio volume reaches a certain treshold. 

Usage:
   1. Download the executable in the main directory here.
   2. Launch/execute the executable.
   3. Select your audio device.
   4. Select the process/program that needs to receive the keypress.
   5. Set your sensitivity and treshold to your liking.
   6. Have fun :D.

### Tech

PressKeyByVoice uses a few external libraries embedded within the executable:

* [NAudio](https://naudio.codeplex.com/) - .NET Library for controlling your audio devices.
* [InputSimulator](https://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/) - Awesome key board simulator that looks to any program like an actual keyboard input!
* 
### Development
This project is just a one off thing, I won't be adding new features unless it's requested a lot. Bug fixes will happen when issues arrise. 

### Todos

- Possibly adding the option to disable key activation via a key combination command (like for example CTRL+A+B to disable/enable).
